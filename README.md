# Activity tracker

The aim of the app is to replace my personal Google sheet, in which I've used for tracking my sport related activities since 3 years. The tasks marked with the ![label: MVP](https://img.shields.io/badge/-MVP-%23bfdadc) label are the ones to be tackled first. With them implemented I should be able to replace the sheet completely. The rest of the tasks is there to make the app better looking, mobile friendly with some useful additional features.
